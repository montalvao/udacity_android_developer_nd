Repository for attending the Android Developer Nanodegree.

## IMPORTANT:
This app works with **The Movie DB** API. My private key can't be publicly disclosed, so you'll have to get your own key and update file `gradle.properties` with the following lines:
```
TMDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
```

For instructions on how to get your key, see The Movie DB [FAQ].
